## Description

The purpose of this application is to provide an application exclusively for car enthusiasts to connect with each other to buy and sell car parts. Through the implementation of a payment system(stripe) users will be able to transfer funds for payment of products in a safe environment. In order to connect buyers and sellers more effectively, the application provides a messaging system for users to communicate. The website catagorises each listing and therefore allows a user to browse through items more efficiently if looking to shop for similar components. In addition, there is also a search function which can further narrow down the listings if looking for a specific part. With the creation of an account, users are able to see a list of their previously bought or sold items in addition to editing, deleting and buying current items on the market.

## Project Management

From early stages in the project a trello board has been used in order to track any tasks throughout the project. This has allowed the developer a clear view of what implementations have priority and if there are any bottlenecks in the development. A colour-coding labeling system has been applied to the trello board in order to direct focus towards requirements at highest priority(Red), additionals at a lowest priority(Yellow) and completed projects(Green). During development, any tasks which were completed would be immediately transferred to the completed tab giving a clear view of the tasks left to be completed.
