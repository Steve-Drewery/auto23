## Project Management

From early stages in the project a trello board has been used in order to track any tasks throughout the project. This has allowed the developer a clear view of what implementations have priority and if there are any bottlenecks in the development. A colour-coding labeling system has been applied to the trello board in order to direct focus towards requirements at highest priority(Red), additionals at a lowest priority(Yellow) and completed projects(Green).
